# PubMedSearch

##Method
I first used BeautifulSoup to crawl abstracts from PubMed.
I used NLTP tokenizer to extract noun and used word2vec to find top 20 similar words with keyword.

##How to Use
You can change it to any noun keyword, but without any spaces.
Press run in Jupyer notebook, and txt file with keyword will be written as a result.
