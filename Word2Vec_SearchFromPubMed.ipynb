      "      the genus rosa (roses) has long been used in traditional or folk medicine worldwide for the treatment of various types of arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. the active constituents of rosa spp., such as flavonoids, triterpenoids, and phytosterols, could act on different targets in the nf-κb signalling pathway, inhibit pro-inflammatory enzymes (e.g. mmps and cox-2), lower the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g. tnf-α, il-1β, il-6, ccl5), and reduce oxidative stress, which in turn suppress inflammatory processes. preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that these species possess analgesic, anti-arthritic, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and bone-preserving activities. this review presents comprehensive overview of the mode and mechanism of action of various extracts, preparations, and active constituents from this genus. the dynamic beneficial effects of the products prepared from this genus in arthritis management are summarized. the rosa genus is a treasure waiting for further exploration by researchers interested in the development of safe and effective anti-arthritic agents.\n",

      "      aluminum is considered an essential element endowed with toxicity potentials in human and animal. thus, intoxication with aluminum can lead to oxidative stress, which is associated with oxidative damage to various macromolecules. moreover, antioxidants from natural sources can play an important role in human health. accordingly, the purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of rosa damascena extract against aluminum-induced oxidative stress. in this study, 60 male rats were randomly divided into six groups and then they were given daily aluminum chloride and rosa damascena extract. after 8 weeks of treatment, the levels of total antioxidant and malondialdehyde, as well as antioxidant enzymes including catalase, glutathione s-transferase, and myeloperoxidase, were measured in all experimental groups in this study. a significant increase was found in the total antioxidant level in the rats treated with aluminum, rosa damascena extract, and aluminum plus rosa damascena extract compared with those in the control group. also, malondialdehyde levels were not significantly different in all the studied groups. glutathione s-transferase activity levels in rats receiving the rosa damascena extract as well as rats taking aluminum with rosa damascena extract increased significantly compared with the ones in the control group. catalase activity in the aluminum-treated group also increased significantly compared with the rates in the control group (31.34 ± 4.50 u/ghb vs. 14.04 ± 6.17 u/ghb, p = 0.014). furthermore, myeloperoxidase activity in the aluminum-treated group increased significantly compared with the control group (49.47 ± 5.12 u/l vs. 25.28 ± 2.18 u/l, p < 0.001). the rosa damascena extract could improve antioxidant capacity and reduce oxidative conditions in rats receiving aluminum chloride as evidenced by assays of the ferric reducing ability of plasma and activity of antioxidant enzymes. according to the findings of this study, it can be concluded that the rosa damascena extract with its high antioxidant content is able to exert a protective effect against aluminum-induced oxidative stress.\n",

      "      rose is the world's most important ornamental plant, with economic, cultural and symbolic value. roses are cultivated worldwide and sold as garden roses, cut flowers and potted plants. roses are outbred and can have various ploidy levels. our objectives were to develop a high-quality reference genome sequence for the genus rosa by sequencing a doubled haploid, combining long and short reads, and anchoring to a high-density genetic map, and to study the genome structure and genetic basis of major ornamental traits. we produced a doubled haploid rose line ('hapob') from rosa chinensis 'old blush' and generated a rose genome assembly anchored to seven pseudo-chromosomes (512 mb with n50 of 3.4 mb and 564 contigs). the length of 512 mb represents 90.1-96.1% of the estimated haploid genome size of rose. of the assembly, 95% is contained in only 196 contigs. the anchoring was validated using high-density diploid and tetraploid genetic maps. we delineated hallmark chromosomal features, including the pericentromeric regions, through annotation of transposable element families and positioned centromeric repeats using fluorescent in situ hybridization. the rose genome displays extensive synteny with the fragaria vesca genome, and we delineated only two major rearrangements. genetic diversity was analysed using resequencing data of seven diploid and one tetraploid rosa species selected from various sections of the genus. combining genetic and genomic approaches, we identified potential genetic regulators of key ornamental traits, including prickle density and the number of flower petals. a rose apetala2/toe homologue is proposed to be the major regulator of petal number in rose. this reference sequence is an important resource for studying polyploidization, meiosis and developmental processes, as we demonstrated for flower and prickle development. it will also accelerate breeding through the development of molecular markers linked to traits, the identification of the genes underlying them and the exploitation of synteny across rosaceae.\n",

      "      stilbenes are naturally scarce high-added-value plant compounds with chemopreventive, pharmacological and cosmetic properties. bioproduction strategies include engineering the metabolisms of bacterial, fungal and plant cell systems. strikingly, one of the most effective strategies consists in the elicitation of wild grapevine cell cultures, which leads to vast stilbene resveratrol accumulation in the extracellular medium. the combination of both cell culture elicitation and metabolic engineering strategies to produce resveratrol analogs proved more efficient for the hydroxylated derivative piceatannol than for the dimethylated derivative pterostilbene, for which human hydroxylase hscyp1b1- and grapevine o-methyltransferase vvromt-transformed cell cultures were respectively used. rose orcinol o-methyltransferase (oomt) displays enzymatic properties, which makes it an appealing candidate to substitute vvromt in the combined strategy to enhance the pterostilbene production level by engineered grapevine cells upon elicitation. here we cloned a rosa hybrida oomt gene, and created a genetic construction suitable for agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. oomt's ability to catalyze the conversion of resveratrol into pterostilbene was first assessed in vitro using protein extracts of agroinfiltrated n. benthamiana leaves and transformed grapevine callus. the grapevine cell cultures transformed with rhoomt produced about 16 mg/l culture of pterostilbene and reached an extracellular distribution of up to 34% of total production at the best, which is by far the highest production reported to date in a plant system. a bonus large resveratrol production of ca. 1500-3000 mg/l was simultaneously obtained. our results demonstrate a viable successful metabolic engineering strategy to produce pterostilbene, a resveratrol analog with enhanced pharmacological properties.\n",

      "      wastewater is an alternative to traditional sources of renewable irrigation water in agriculture, particularly in water-scarce regions. however, the possible risks due to heavy metals accumulation in plant tissues are often overlooked by producers. the present study aimed to identify heavy metals-induced structural modifications to roots of scented rosa species that were irrigated with water of marginal quality. the chemical and mineral contents from the experimental irrigation canal water (control) and treated wastewater were below the limits recommended by the pakistan environmental protection agency (pak-epa) for medicinal plants. the experimentally untreated wastewater contained electrical conductivity (ec), chemical oxygen demand (cod), biological oxygen demand (bod), and heavy metals (co, cu, cd, pb) that were above the recommended limits. the responses by wastewater-treated rosa species (rosa damascena, r. bourboniana, r. gruss-an-teplitz, and r. centifolia) were evaluated. the experimental data revealed that treated wastewater significantly increased the thickness of collenchyma (cortex and pith) and parenchyma tissues (vascular bundle, xylem, and phloem) of r. gruss-an-teplitz. root dermal tissues (epidermis) of r. bourboniana also responded to treated wastewater. r. damascena and r. centifolia were the least affected species, under the experimental irrigation conditions. collenchyma and dermal tissues were thicker in r. damascena and r. gruss-an-teplitz under untreated wastewater conditions. in parenchyma tissues, vascular bundles were thicker in r. damascena in untreated wastewater conditions, while the xylem and phloem of r. gruss-an-teplitz were thicker where treated wastewater was applied. in tissues other than the vascular bundle, the differences in anatomical metrics due to the experimental irrigation treatments were greater during the second year of the experiment than in the first year. the contents of metals other than chromium in the roots and stems of roses were below the who limits, under all of the experimental irrigation conditions. rosa centifolia contained higher heavy metals content than the other experimental species, and heavy metals content was associated with anatomical changes due to the treatments. we conclude that, under conditions of wastewater irrigation, r. gruss-an-teplitz was highly resistant; r. damascena was moderately resistant while r. bourboniana and r. centifolia were the most susceptible to irrigation with marginal quality water. this is the first report of plant tissue responses to wastewater irrigation by the experimental species. regarding the accumulation of heavy metals in rose plant tissues, the results confirm that untreated wastewater must be treated to grow rosa species where water is scarce.\n",

      "      the petals of rosa rugosa are generally pink and purple, never yellow. although new varieties of r. rugosa have been bred, no yellow variety has ever been obtained. therefore, the use of roses in garden settings has been restricted. three r. rugosa hybrid cultivars (r. rugosa 'miaoyu', 'rudiepianpian' and 'jiaomeisanbian') were bred in our laboratory using wild r. rugosa 'hunchun' as the female parent and rosa xanthina as the male parent. the petals of these cultivars appear yellow, at least in part; thus, these cultivars represent the first r. rugosa with yellow flowers. to investigate the causes of this yellow petal color, the petals of these materials were studied at both the physiological and molecular levels. anthocyanins are the most important chromogenic substances in plants. in this study, six types of anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-o-glucoside (cy3g), cyanidin-3,5-di-o-glucoside (cy3g5g), pelargonidin-3-o-glucoside (pg3g), pelargonidin-3,5-di-o-glucoside (pg3g5g), peonidin-3-o-glucoside (pn3g) and peonidin-3,5-di-o-glucoside (pn3g5g), were analyzed in the petals of the new r. rugosa cultivars and their parents. all of the above anthocyanins were found in the petals of 'hunchun', and a small amount of cy3g5g was present in 'miaoyu' and 'jiaomeisanbian', but no anthocyanins were found in r. xanthina or 'rudiepianpian'. moreover, the expression levels of seven structural genes (rrchs, rrchi, rrf3h, rrfls, rrf3'h, rrdfr and rrans) in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway were quantitatively analyzed via qrt-pcr. we concluded that rrfls, rrdfr and rrf3'h are the key genes controlling petal color in these different rose varieties.\n",

      "rosa chinensis var. spontanea, an endemic and endangered plant of china, is one of the key ancestors of modern roses and a source for famous traditional chinese medicines against female diseases, such as irregular menses and dysmenorrhea. in this study, the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of r. chinensis var. spontanea was sequenced, analyzed, and compared to congeneric species. the cp genome of r. chinensis var. spontanea is a typical quadripartite circular molecule of 156,590 bp in length, including one large single copy (lsc) region of 85,910 bp and one small single copy (ssc) region of 18,762 bp, separated by two inverted repeat (ir) regions of 25,959 bp. the gc content of the whole genome is 37.2%, while that of lsc, ssc, and ir is 42.8%, 35.2% and 31.2%, respectively. the genome encodes 129 genes, including 84 protein-coding genes (pcgs), 37 transfer rna (trna) genes, and eight ribosomal rna (rrna) genes. seventeen genes in the ir regions were found to be duplicated. thirty-three forward and five inverted repeats were detected in the cp genome of r. chinensis var. spontanea. the genome is rich in ssrs. in total, 85 ssrs were detected. a genome comparison revealed that ir contraction might be the reason for the relatively smaller cp genome size of r. chinensis var. spontanea compared to other congeneric species. sequence analysis revealed that the lsc and ssc regions were more divergent than the ir regions within the genus rosa and that a higher divergence occurred in non-coding regions than in coding regions. a phylogenetic analysis showed that the sampled species of the genus rosa formed a monophyletic clade and that r. chinensis var. spontanea shared a more recent ancestor with r. lichiangensis of the section synstylae than with r. odorata var. gigantea of the section chinenses. this information will be useful for the conservation genetics of r. chinensis var. spontanea and for the phylogenetic study of the genus rosa, and it might also facilitate the genetics and breeding of modern roses.\n",

      "      rosa laevigata fruit has been known as a functional foodstuff for a long time. recently, increasing attention has been given to polysaccharides from r. laevigata fruit due to their numerous medicinal and nutritional properties. in this study, a rapid and effective approach for the extraction and separation of polysaccharides from the title fruit was developed using microwave-assisted aqueous two-phase extraction (ma-atpe) with a peg/ammonium sulfate system. after analysis of the response surface methodology (rsm) data based on a box-behnken design (bbd), a model was proposed and was found to predict an optimum yield value of 258.99 mg g-1 which is in good agreement with the experimental value (258.59 mg g-1). two selenium (se)-containing polysaccharides, se-rlfp-1 and se-rlfp-2, were isolated from r. laevigata fruit. their chemical structures were elucidated by acid hydrolysis, weight-average molecular mass and se-content analysis, along with uv, ft-ir, 1h and 13c nmr spectroscopy. as a result, se-rlfp-1 was found to be mainly composed of mannose, glucose, galactose and xylose in a molar ratio of 1.4 : 7.9 : 1.0 : 1.5, while se-rlfp-2 was composed of mannose, rhamnose, glucose, galactose and xylose (12.6 : 1.0 : 38.3 : 5.6 : 19.6). furthermore, the antioxidant properties of the polysaccharides were investigated on the basis of frap, abts and dpph radical scavenging assays. the results showed that the two polysaccharides had a noticeable effect on the radical scavenging of abts and dpph, especially at high concentrations. in addition, the neuroprotective effect of se-rlfp-1 and se-rlfp-2 against oxidative stress induced by h2o2 in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells was also investigated. in particular, se-rlfp-1 exhibited obvious neuroprotective activity at a concentration of 100 μg ml-1.\n",

      "      radioprotection is an important approach to reduce the side-effects of radiotherapy. the radioprotective effect of the flavonoids of rosa roxburghii tratt (frt) has been confirmed, and the mechanism has been identified as thebcl-2/caspase-3/parp-1 signaling pathway. in this study, we investigated the effects of frt on the intercellular adhesion molecule (icam), and vascular cell adhesion protein (vcam) in addition to apoptosis-related proteins such as bax/bcl-2, p-erk/erk, p-p53/p53, and p-p38/p38. in the present study, we focused on the effect of frt on parp-1/aif. ionizing radiation triggered the activation of parp-1 and aif translocation from the mitochondrion to the nucleus. the inhibition of parp-1/aif signaling pathway by frt was investigated. our results showed that the expressions of bax/bcl-2, p-erk/ erk, p-p53/p53, and p-p38/p38 were decreased after frt treatment compared with the radiation-treated group. frt inhibited parp-1 activation to inhibit aif translocation from mitochondrion to nucleus. pretreatment with frt diminished the comet's tail and reduced fragments in six gy-irradiated thymocytes compared with the irradiated cells without frt treatment. we conclude that frt enhanced radioprotection at least partially by regulating parp-1/aif to reduce apoptosis. j. cell. biochem. 118: 3943-3952, 2017. © 2017 wiley periodicals, inc.\n",

      "rosa chinensis is one of the most popular flower plants worldwide. the recurrent flowering trait greatly enhances the ornamental value of roses, and is the result of the constant formation of new flower buds. flower bud differentiation has always been a major topic of interest among researchers. the apetala1 (ap1) mads-box (mcm1, agamous, deficiens and srf) transcription factor-encoding gene is important for the formation of the floral meristem and floral organs. however, research on the rose ap1 gene has been limited. thus, we isolated ap1 from rosa chinensis 'old blush'. an expression analysis revealed that rcap1 was not expressed before the floral primordia formation stage in flower buds. the overexpression of rcap1 in arabidopsis thaliana resulted in an early-flowering phenotype. additionally, the virus-induced down-regulation of rcap1 expression delayed flowering in 'old blush'. moreover, rcap1 was specifically expressed in the sepals of floral organs, while its expression was down-regulated in abnormal sepals and leaf-like organs. these observations suggest that rcap1 may contribute to rose bud differentiation as well as floral organ morphogenesis, especially the sepals. these results may help for further characterization of the regulatory mechanisms of the recurrent flowering trait in rose.\n",

      "      at present, research on the flower color of rosa rugosa requires very innovative and practical studies. glycosylation plays an important role in increasing the stability and solubility of anthocyanins in plants. in this study, a gene with a full-length cdna of 1161 bp encoding 386 amino acids, designated rrgt1 (mk034140), was isolated from the flowers of r. rugosa 'zizhi' and then functionally characterized. sequence alignment revealed that the coding regions of rrgt1 were highly specific among different species but still contained typical conserved amino acid residues that are crucial for rrgt1 enzyme activity. rrgt1 transcripts were detected in various tissues of r. rugosa 'zizhi' and rosa davurica, and their expression patterns corresponded with the accumulation of anthocyanins. additionally, the in vivo function of rrgt1 was investigated via its overexpression in arabidopsis thaliana. transgenic arabidopsis plants expressing rrgt1 regained red color pigmentation of their leaves and flower stems, indicating that rrgt1 could encode a functional glycosyltransferase (gt) protein for anthocyanin biosynthesis and could function in other species. the functional verification of rrgt1 for anthocyanin biosynthesis in r. rugosa was performed via virus-induced gene silencing (vigs). this was the first time that a vigs system was developed for use with perennial rosa plants grown naturally in the field as experimental materials to study a key color-controlling gene in rosa. when the rrgt1 gene was silenced, the rosa plants displayed a pale petal color phenotype. the detection results showed that the expression of the endogenous rrgt1 gene was significantly downregulated while the six key structural genes in its upstream were normally expressed, and the contents of all anthocyanins also decreased significantly. therefore, we speculated that glycosylation of rrgt1 plays a crucial role in anthocyanin biosynthesis in r. rugosa.\n",

      "      rosa rugosa thunb, a deciduous shrub of the genus rosa, has been widely used to treat stomach aches, diarrhoea, pain, and chronic inflammatorydisease in eastern asia. in recent years, our research team has extensively studied the rosa rugosa flowerextract, and specificallyundertook pharmacological experiments which have optimized the extraction process. our methods have yielded a standard extract enriched in phenolic compounds, named pre. herein, we expand our efforts and evaluated the antiinflammatoryactivity of pre on lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced inflammationin raw 264.7 macrophages. pre significantlyinhibited production of nitric oxide (no), prostaglandin e2 (pge2), tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α, interleukin (il)-6, and interleukin 1β (il-1β), as well as expression of their synthesizing enzymes, inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) and cyclooxygenase2 (cox-2). furthermore, pre inhibited activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapk) as well as nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-κb) signaling pathway. our findingsare the firstto explain the anti-inflammatorymechanism by pre in lps-stimulated macrophages. given these results, we propose that pre has therapeutic potential in the prevention of inflammatory disorders. \n",

      "      the effects of dietary rosa mosqueta (rm, rosa rubiginosa) oil, rich in α-linolenic acid, in the prevention of liver steatosis were studied in mice fed a high fat diet (hfd). c57bl/6j mice were fed either a control diet or hfd with or without rm oil for 12 weeks. the results indicate that rm oil supplementation decreases fat infiltration of the liver from 43.8% to 6.2%, improving the hepatic oxidative state, insulin levels, homa index, and both body weight and adipose tissue weight of hfd plus rm treated animals compared to hfd without supplementation. in addition, the dha concentration in the liver was significantly increased in hfd fed mice with rm oil compared to hfd (3 vs. 1.6 g per 100 g fame). the n-6/n-3 ratio was not significantly modified by treatment with rm. our findings suggest that rm oil supplementation prevents the development of hepatic steatosis and the obese phenotype observed in hfd fed mice. \n",

      "      in this study, a gene with a full-length cdna of 1422 bp encoding 473 amino acids, designated rrgt2, was isolated from r. rugosa 'zizhi' and then functionally characterized. rrgt2 transcripts were detected in various tissues and were proved that their expression patterns corresponded with anthocyanins accumulation. functional verification of rrgt2 in r. rugosa was performed via vigs. when rrgt2 was silenced, the rosa plants displayed a pale petal color phenotype. the detection results showed that the expression of rrgt2 was significantly downregulated, which was consistent with the decrease of all anthocyanins; while the expression of six key upstream structural genes was normal. additionally, the in vivo function of rrgt2 was investigated via its overexpression in tobacco. in transgenic tobacco plants expressing rrgt2, anthocyanin accumulation was induced in the flowers, indicating that rrgt2 could encode a functional gt protein for anthocyanin biosynthesis and could function in other species. the application of vigs in transgenic tobacco resulted in the treated tobacco plants presenting flowers whose phenotypes were lighter in color than those of normal plants. these results also validated and affirmed previous conclusions. therefore, we speculated that glycosylation of rrgt2 plays a crucial role in anthocyanin biosynthesis in r. rugosa.\n",

      "      plants often develop the capacity to tolerate moderate and reversible environmental stresses, such as drought, and to re-establish normal development once the stress has been removed. an example of this phenomenon is provided by cut rose (rosa hybrida) flowers, which experience typical reversible dehydration stresses during post-harvest handling after harvesting at the bud stages. the molecular mechanisms involved in rose flower dehydration tolerance are not known, however. here, we characterized a dehydration- and abscisic acid (aba)-induced ferritin gene (rhfer1). dehydration-induced free ferrous iron (fe2+ ) is preferentially sequestered by rhfer1 and not transported outside of the petal cells, to restrict oxidative stresses during dehydration. free fe2+ accumulation resulted in more serious oxidative stresses and the induction of genes encoding antioxidant enzyme in rhfer1-silenced petals, and poorer dehydration tolerance was observed compared with tobacco rattle virus (trv) controls. we also determined that rhabf2, an areb/abf transcription factor involved in the aba signaling pathway, can activate rhfer1 expression by directly binding to its promoter. the silencing of rhabf2 decreased dehydration tolerance and disrupted fe homeostasis in rose petals during dehydration, as did the silencing of rhfer1. although both rhfer1 and fe transporter genes are induced during flower natural senescence in plants, the silencing of rhabf2 or rhfer1 accelerates the petal senescence processes. these results suggest that the regulatory module rhabf2/rhfer1 contributes to the maintenance of fe levels and enhances dehydration tolerance through the action of rhfer1 locally sequestering free fe2+ under dehydration conditions, and plays synergistic roles with transporter genes during flower senescence.\n",

      "      hybridization with introduced genetic resources is commonly practiced in ornamental plant breeding to introgress desired traits. the 19th century was a golden age for rose breeding in france. the objective here was to study the evolution of rose genetic diversity over this period, which included the introduction of asian genotypes into europe. a large sample of 1228 garden roses encompassing the conserved diversity cultivated during the 18th and 19th centuries was genotyped with 32 microsatellite primer pairs. its genetic diversity and structure were clarified. wide diversity structured in 16 genetic groups was observed. genetic differentiation was detected between ancient european and asian accessions, and a temporal shift from a european to an asian genetic background was observed in cultivated european hybrids during the 19th century. frequent crosses with asian roses throughout the 19th century and/or selection for asiatic traits may have induced this shift. in addition, the consistency of the results with respect to a horticultural classification is discussed. some horticultural groups, defined according to phenotype and/or knowledge of their pedigree, seem to be genetically more consistent than others, highlighting the difficulty of classifying cultivated plants. therefore, the horticultural classification is probably more appropriate for commercial purposes rather than genetic relatedness, especially to define preservation and breeding strategies.\n",

      "      anthocyanidin reductase (anr) is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins (pas) and plays a role in the plant stress response. however, the mechanism by which anr confers stress tolerance in plants is not understood. here, we report the isolation of rranr, the homologous gene from rose, and ntabf, an aba-response related transcription factor gene from tobacco. these genes were characterized regarding their functions in stress responses through the use of transgenic, transcriptomic and physiological analyses. over-expression of rranr in tobacco resulted in an increased accumulation of both pas and abscisic acid (aba), and also enhanced stress tolerance. transcriptomic analysis of these transgenic tobacco lines indicated that rranr overexpression induced global transcriptomic changes, including these involved in oxidation/reduction, hormone response and secondary metabolism. genes related to aba biosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ros)-scavenging were up-regulated in rranr transgenic lines, and these effects were phenocopied by the direct treatment of tobacco plants with pas and aba. transcriptomic data from each of these treatments identified the upregulation of a putative ntabf. furthermore, the up-regulation of ntabf in rranr transformants or in pas- and aba-treated tobacco plants was associated with enhanced stress tolerance. overexpression of ntabf in transgenic tobacco mimicked the effects of rranr-transgenic plants with regard to the up-regulation of ros-scavenging genes and an increase in oxidative tolerance. taken together, our findings indicate that overexpression of rranr results in an increase in plant tolerance to oxidative stress via increased scavenging of ros and modulation of the aba signaling pathway. \n",

      "      hydrosol prepared from the flowers of rosa damascena (rose water) has been traditionally used for various health-related issues, including skin troubles such as erythema, itchiness, swelling. for the care of these skin troubles caused by microbial infection, both antimicrobial and antiinflammatory effects are required. here, we investigated the effects of rose water on the growth of candida albicans and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), which cause skin infections, and on the function of neutrophils, which play a major role in the regulation of inflammatory reactions. to assess its modulatory effects on neutrophils, the effects of rose water against neutrophil adhesion response were evaluated. rose water inhibited mycelial growth of c. albicans at a concentration of ca. 2.2%, and reduced viability of mrsa within 1 h. rose water suppressed neutrophil activation induced by lipopolysaccharide (lps), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-α), and n-formyl-met-leu-phe (fmlp) at 5-15%. it also reduced the lps- and tnf-α-induced cell surface expression of the adhesion-related molecule, cluster of differentiation (cd) 11b, but did not affect the migratory capacity of neutrophils with or without chemoattractant. these results suggest that rose water may reduce the pathogenicity of microbes, and attenuate neutrophil stimulation, which is involved in inflammatory responses. these findings suggest that rose water has a potential effect to inhibit skin inflammation caused by microbes.\n",

      "      viral neuraminidase inhibitors are widely used as synthetic anti-influenza drugs for the prevention and treatment of influenza. however, drug-resistant influenza a virus variants, including h5n1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (hpaivs), have been reported. therefore, the discovery of novel and effective antiviral agents is warranted. we screened the antiviral effects of 11 herbal tea extracts (hibiscus, black tea, tencha, rosehip tea, burdock tea, green tea, jasmine tea, ginger tea, lavender tea, rose tea and oak tea) against the h5n1 hpaiv in vitro. among the tested extracts, only the hibiscus extract and its fractionated extract (frhibis) highly and rapidly reduced the titers of all h5 hpaivs and low pathogenic aivs (lpaivs) used in the pre-treatment tests of madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) cells that were inoculated with a mixture of the virus and the extract. immunogold electron microscopy showed that anti-h5 monoclonal antibodies could not bind to the deformed h5 virus particles pretreated with frhibis. in post-treatment tests of mdck cells cultured in the presence of frhibis after infection with h5n1 hpaiv, the frhibis inhibited viral replication and the expression of viral antigens and genes. among the plants tested, hibiscus showed the most prominent antiviral effects against both h5 hpaiv and lpaiv.\n",

      "      poor wound healing is a major and global threat to public health. efforts have been made to better understand the underlying mechanisms and develop effective remedies, though the advancements that have been made are still limited. as there are no effective and generally applicable therapies available for skin injuries and fibrosis, it is urgent to develop new drugs and therapies that facilitate wound healing and effectively improve scars. in this study, gc-ms analysis was performed to identify the chemical composition of rosehip oil. the excisional wound healing model and the carrageenan-induced paw edema method were respectively applied to evaluate the wound healing activity and anti-inflammatory activity of rosehip oil. hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to assess the pathological changes of sections, and sirius-red staining was performed to analyze the ratio of collagen i/iii in wound tissues. immunohistological staining for cd68, ccr7 (cd197), cd163, tgf-β1, and α-sma was applied to determine the macrophage phenotypes transition (m1-to-m2) and demonstrate the scar-improving efficacy of rosehip oil on wound healing. results showed that rosehip oil significantly promoted wound healing and effectively improved scars. this efficacy might be exerted by accelerating the macrophage phenotypes transition and inhibiting the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.\n",
